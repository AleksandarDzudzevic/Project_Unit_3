# Criterion A: Planning 
### Definition of the Problem
UWC ISAK Japan is a school that always strives to be more environmentally friendly, but due to high demand for copies of ISAK INSIDER articles every week, a lot of paper is being used to print them. This especially bothered Jonathan Wang Ye, who is considered by many, number one environmentalist at ISAK, porbably even Japan. He is in urgent need for an UWC ISAK journalism club application which would store articles that ISAK INSIDER publishes every week in addition to storing articles from past weeks. Additional benefit of this would be that would be available and ready to be read anywhere in the world, allowing fans and alumni of the school outside ISAK to enjoy it.
This way everyone would be able to enjoy ISAK INSIDER without hurting the environment and wasting paper in the process.

Consider the following key questions 
Who is the client?
Why is the product being developed
### Rationale for proposed solution
The rationale behind the choice of the proposed product must be in extended writing justifying how the choice of this particular product is an effective solution.
### Success criteria

The success criteria (that are evaluated in criterion E) should be listed in the form of bullet points.


# Criterion B: Solution Overview 
### Test Plan
This is a list of step, table, or flow chart specifying the process for testing the solution with the inputs and expected outputs.

### Diagrams
System diagram, wireframe for the GUI, flow diagram, ER diagram for the database, and UML diagram for the OOP classes.

# Criterion C: Development
### Existing tools
This refers to the software tools used during the development of the solution, and structures such as for loops, and bash commands
### Sources
When code was researched in the web, proper citation is used to give credit to the original author.
### Tools used:
1. OOP paradigm
2. KivyMD Library
3. Relational databases
4. SQLite, ORM
5. Hashing
6. csv.file data storing and reading

# Criterion D: Functionality 
### Format
A video demonstrating the testing for the success criteria.

Max. length 4 min
### Extensibility
The last 30s of the video should include a discussion of how the code is well organized so that future developers can extend it
### Appendex
